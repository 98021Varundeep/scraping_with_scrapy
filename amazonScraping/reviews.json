{"asin": "B09G9FPHY6", "text": "Its really comes down to preference but you can't really go wrong with an Ipad.  It boils down to which one and that all depends on your needs, as we all know there are a bunch of different models and price points. Picking the right one is an important decision because it will play into your overall satisfaction with your investment. You may be left sadly disappointed if you purchase too much tablet for your needs or if you purchase one that doesn't have all the features needed. The Ipad 9th gen is a solid choice for most households and individuals. If you're looking for a long lasting tablet for browsing,email,notes and even light creative work this is the one for you!DesignQuality design and feel as to be expected with an apple product( I'd recommend getting a case). I like the screen/body ratio (definitely has more screen than previous generations). Touch Id is always a bonus on any technology. My only wish is that this model had the usb-c charging port vs the lightning charging port.UsabilityEven if you have never used an apple product before you'll figure it out and so will your grandparents. Everything is straightforward and the updated A13 Chip is definitely speedy and like I said earlier, can handle most basic tasks. If you're used to android the one difference to take into consideration is the app market between google play and apple's app store (but most major apps are available on both).ValueAt its current discounted price of 200$ Its a great buy if its within your budget of course. Its seldom that apple products go on sale and so right now may be solid time to get one!", "title": "The one you should probably get!", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2024", "verified": false, "rating": "5.0"},

Easy, like a charm.Even now, with how much time has passed since I bought it, it still works like new! It doesn't lag so drawing isn't a hassle, and personally, it's the perfect size, too. Not too small, nor too big. The quality of the screen is also perfect, and the split screen feature? Soooo useful.My only complaint: I wish the battery life was a teensy bit better, but that's trivial.I still honestly can't recommend it enough, especially at under $400 (without tax, at least), it's cheaper than a lot of screen tablets with more features, too.", "title": "An Artist’s Best Friend", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2024", "verified": false, "rating": "5.0"},

{"asin": "B09G9FPHY6", "text": "The older ipads required me to use the cloud service to switch devices, that is no longer the case.. Also I hate cloud services cause they are a security risk as if anyone hacks your cloud service account, they get everything you have there, its not a good idea..  This is my moms new ipad cause her old Ipad Air 2 battery bit the dust.. I asked gemini how much faster this one was and it said 2 to 2.5 times faster than my 6th gen ipad, but the ipad air 2's I think it said the ipad air 2s are 5 times slower than the A13's..  For the record , I have a quest 3 VR headset and Gemini said its performance is on par with a M! or M2 processor, and the Quest 3 is designed for VR/AR applications whereas the ipads are not.. I have noticed in web browser performance the Quest 3 is super fast.. IT was question cause I use USIO and the V1.5 update of the Web Interface is super sluggish on my 6th gen ipad..  According to Gemini the A14 is 20% faster.. And the M1 is significant;y faster, like a 100-200% speed up.. But you can ask Gemini about that stuff.  The Quest 3 I have is the 512GB model, its about $800.. So if youa re thinking about the Vision Pro, my opinion is to wait until its proved itself, the Quest 3 roughly the same performance, and you will have to get all new apps for the vision pro to use VR, the Quest 3 is all vr..Anyhow back to the A13 based ipad here.. To install it all we had to do is take the old iPAd Air 2 with ios 9 I think it was.. and hover it over the new ipad, the new ipad had this starfield in a sphere that was moving. I also had top enable the bluetooth on the old ipad.. IT took in all about 10 minutes to setup, and didn't require password access, it only use the pin and touch to setup.. It would first connect via bluetooth, possibly using a Asymmetric KEy encryption like your web browser, thats is a foolproof way of connecting devices over untrusted networks.. They will then exchance a symmetrixc key which is impossible to hack, the asymmetric is is more impossible but it requires a lot more processing power thats why its only used for the initial handshake to setup the connection. Asymmetric keys cannot be used without both ends of the connection having the same key, and if you passed that over without a secure connection, it would be dead easy to decrypt. If it wasn't for Asymmetric key encryption business would not be possible on the Internet. Well I take that back, asymmetric key encryption combined with a certificate server which validates the connection between both parties to prevent middle man attacks, is necessary for business on the net.. Anyhow you can tell I'm a brainiac..It really only required hand holding for me to install this pad.. My mom is easily intimidated.. But I'm sure she could have done it on her own talking to some telephone support from appl if it came to that. But cause I'm in the same house, it was easier for her..The screen seemed larger than her old Ipad Air 2.. She has two of those, one only has 16GBs on it.. I decided I need one myself,so I got the exact same model to replace my 6th gen iPad.. The screen scale is larger than our old iPads.. So it should berefreshing to use.. It also said something about reduced glare, and Apple gen 1 pencil support, which makes it great for artists, giving it tilt and pressure support.. But I'm a AI guy, so I prompt everything..", "title": "Super Easy to Setup", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2024", "verified": false, "rating": "5.0"},
{"asin": "B09G9FPHY6", "text": "My original iPad 5th generation was great for 7 years but it only had 32GB of storage, so eventually, it ran out of space and I would have to delete a lot of stuff before I could even update the iOS version.  I plan to keep this one a long time so I opted for the 256GB for only $150 more. It will be worth it in the long run.  The transfer of info from my old to new iPad was a breeze.  You just need both plugged in, sitting side by side and they communicate.  It was very easy and I’m not a techie.  The only problem was my new iPad wouldn’t open the Kindle app.  All I had to do was Deregister my old iPad, delete and reinstall the Kindle app.  Then it let me login without issue and my existing library was intact.  The 9th generation operates like my old one so there is no learning curve.  It does have some cool additions but they are self explanatory.  This uses a “C” a/c adaptor and cord but guess what? They INCLUDE one of each in the box. Wahooo!  As with all Apple products, it is slim and slippery so get a protective case. I chose the ZUGU Flip Case and it’s 5 stars also.

I paid around $340 and thought it was worth it then - at the current $250 price tag you can't beat it!It's a great little device for note taking of course, but its also great for digital media consumption. I've found the screen size and resolution to be more than good enough for enjoying YouTube videos, movies, manga, etc. while still being a comfortable size to take with you. It's a nice middle ground between a phone and something more substantial like a laptop or TV.As for the age of this model, I have found that the processor and storage are sufficient for my use cases. No stuttering or loading at all. Of course, I only do light tasks on my iPad, but why would you want any more? That's what a laptop is good for (as much as Apple wishes otherwise)!With so many Apple products rushing to break the bank while removing legitimately useful features, you really can't go wrong with something like this.

If you are looking to use an iPad for artistic purposes, getting one with the more accurate colors would be worth it, but this iPad is sufficient for most day to day applications. I would recommend this over the iPad 10th gen, because you spend less and you don’t lose much, except for usb c and the new design, and this iPad 9th gen has a headphone jack, which some may care about, it is convenient to have. The new iPad does not have one, so if you plan to use wired headphones with the iPad, I would go with the 9th gen. But overall it is a very good device for most people in my opinion, and that the more expensive ones are pretty overkill if you just want to use basic tablet applications.", "title": "Is a basic ipad", "location_and_date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2024", "verified": false, "rating": "5.0"},
